**This project also contains multiple CSV files** which are outputted by ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code_XXu_SPalurMallampalli_NWatson.ipynb such as [category.csv](https://github.com/HollaNotes/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/category.csv), [subcategory.csv](https://github.com/HollaNotes/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/subcategory.csv), [campaign.csv](https://github.com/HollaNotes/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/campaign.csv), [contacts.csv](https://github.com/HollaNotes/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/contacts.csv), and [contacts_regex.csv](https://github.com/HollaNotes/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/contacts_regex.csv).

## **Part 1: Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames**
**Create a Category DataFrame that has the following columns:**
- A "category_id" column that is numbered sequential form 1 to the length of the number of unique categories.
- A "category" column that has only the categories.

Export the DataFrame as a `category.csv` CSV file.

**Create a SubCategory DataFrame that has the following columns:**
- A "subcategory_id" column that is numbered sequential form 1 to the length of the number of unique subcategories.
- A "subcategory" column that has only the subcategories. 

Export the DataFrame as a `subcategory.csv` CSV file.

- The "subcategory_id" with the unique number matching the “subcategory_id” from the subcategory DataFrame.
- And, create a column that contains the unique four-digit contact ID number from the `contact.xlsx` file.
 

Then export the DataFrame as a `campaign.csv` CSV file.
